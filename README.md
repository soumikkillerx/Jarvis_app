ARVIS - Your Personal Assistant
Overview
JARVIS is a voice-controlled personal assistant application built using Python. It leverages various libraries to provide a range of functionalities. The application can perform web searches, tell jokes, provide the current time, set reminders, and much more.

Features
Voice Recognition: Understands and processes voice commands using the speech_recognition library.


Text-to-Speech: Responds with voice feedback using the pyttsx3 library.

Web Search: Opens Google with the search query.

YouTube Access: Opens YouTube in the default web browser.

Jokes: Tells random jokes using the pyjokes library.

Time Reporting: Provides the current time.

Reminders: Sets reminders with a specified message.

Open Source: Ongoing development with open-source contributions.


Voice Commands and Corresponding Actions
1. Search Command

Trigger: "search <query>"
Example: If you say "search Python programming", the application will open Google and search for "Python programming".
Code Handling: The text is parsed to extract the query, which is then used to construct a Google search URL.
2. YouTube Command

Trigger: "open YouTube" or "open youtube"
Example: If you say "open YouTube", the application will open YouTube in the default web browser.
Code Handling: Opens the YouTube website.
3. Time Command

Example: If you say "what time is it", the application will respond with the current time.
Code Handling: Retrieves the current time using the datetime module and speaks it out.
4. Joke Command

Trigger: "tell me a joke"
Example: If you say "tell me a joke", the application will respond with a random joke.
Code Handling: Fetches a random joke using the pyjokes library and speaks it out.
5. Reminder Command

Trigger: "set reminder"
Example: If you say "set a reminder", the application sets a reminder for 10 seconds (hardcoded) and then speaks the reminder message.
Code Handling: Uses threading to wait for the specified time and then speaks the reminder message.
6. Exit Command

Trigger: "exit" or "quit"
Example: If you say "exit" or "quit", the application will terminate.
Code Handling: Exits the application by calling exit().
7. Default Response
