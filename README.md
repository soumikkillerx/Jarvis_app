JARVIS is a voice-controlled personal assistant application built using Python. It leverages various libraries such as speech_recognition, pyttsx3, spacy, webbrowser, pyjokes, and more to provide a range of functionalities. This application can perform web searches, tell jokes, provide the current time, set reminders, and much more.

Features
Voice Recognition: Understands and processes voice commands using the speech_recognition library.
Text-to-Speech: Responds with voice feedback using the pyttsx3 library.
Web Search: Opens Google with search queries.
YouTube Access: Opens YouTube directly.
Jokes: Tells random jokes using the pyjokes library.
Time Reporting: Provides the current time.
Reminders: Sets reminders with a specified message.
Open Source: Ongoing development with open-source contributions.


Code Analysis
1. Initialization

nlp: Loads the English language model from SpaCy for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
recognizer: Initializes the speech recognizer.
tts_engine: Initializes the text-to-speech engine.
2. Greetings

A list of greetings is randomly selected and spoken when the application starts.
3. Command Handling

start_recognition: Continuously listens for voice input and processes the commands using the recognize_speech and handle_command methods.
4. Voice Command Processing

recognize_speech: Converts audio input to text using Google's speech recognition service.

speak_text: Converts text to speech and speaks it out loud.

handle_command: Processes the recognized text and performs actions based on specific commands.

Voice Commands and Corresponding Actions
1. Search Command

Trigger: "search <query>"
Example: If you say "search Python programming", the application will open Google and search for "Python programming".
Code Handling: The text is parsed to extract the query, which is then used to construct a Google search URL.
2. YouTube Command

Trigger: "open YouTube" or "open youtube"
Example: If you say "open YouTube", the application will open YouTube in the default web browser.
Code Handling: Opens the YouTube website.
3. Time Command

Trigger: "time"
Example: If you say "what time is it", the application will respond with the current time.
Code Handling: Retrieves the current time using the datetime module and speaks it out.
4. Joke Command

Trigger: "tell me a joke"
Example: If you say "tell me a joke", the application will respond with a random joke.
Code Handling: Fetches a random joke using the pyjokes library and speaks it out.
5. Reminder Command

Trigger: "set reminder"
Example: If you say "set a reminder", the application sets a reminder for 10 seconds (hardcoded) and then speaks the reminder message.
Code Handling: Uses threading to wait for the specified time and then speaks the reminder message.
6. Exit Command

Trigger: "exit" or "quit"
Example: If you say "exit" or "quit", the application will terminate.
Code Handling: Exits the application by calling exit().
7. Default Response

Trigger: Any command that does not match the predefined commands.
Example: If you say "play music", which is not a defined command, the application will respond with "I don't know how to respond to that."
Code Handling: Provides a default response for unrecognized commands.
Summary
Search: Opens Google with the query.
YouTube: Opens the YouTube website.
Time: Provides the current time.
Joke: Tells a random joke.
Reminder: Sets a reminder and notifies after a delay.
Exit: Terminates the application.
Default: Responds with a fallback message for unrecognized command
